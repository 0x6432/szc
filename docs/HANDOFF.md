# Handoff

Read this first when resuming work (the sandbox resets often).

## Resume checklist

1. `git clone https://github.com/0x6432/szc && cd szc` (or `git pull`).
2. Git identity for commits: `git config user.name 0x42 && git config user.email noreply@localhost`.
3. Tools: `gcc`/`clang`, `make`, `python3`. For sanitizers on Amazon Linux:
   `sudo dnf install -y libasan libubsan clang compiler-rt`.
   QBE: `git clone git://c9x.me/qbe.git && make -C qbe` (needed from M3.4).
4. `make test && make fuzz-standalone` must pass before new work.
5. Check `docs/MILESTONES.md` for the next unchecked milestone.
6. Push after every milestone (and more often during long ones).
   The GitHub token is **never** committed. Restore authenticated Git access if needed.

## Current state

- Done: M0 (infrastructure), M1 (lexer), M2 (AST + parser, differential-tested against
  `std.zig.Ast`).
- Done: M3.1–M3.2 (untyped IR + irgen basics, `szc ir`).
- Done: M3.3 (typed IR + minimal sema, `szc tir`).
- Done: M3.4 QBE codegen + driver (`emit-qbe`, `build-exe`, `run`), integer casts.
- Done: M3.5 executable/driver harness + generated integer-width tests and CI.
- Done: M3.6a checked arithmetic, casts, unsigned division/shift guards and panic stub.
- Done: M3.6b runtime saturation and explicit division/remainder builtins.
- Next: **M4.1** source-level if/else (comparisons and boolean short-circuit are already supported).
- Run `PATH=/data/tools/bin:$PATH ZIG=/data/zig/zig-x86_64-linux-0.17.0/zig make e2e-test`
  locally. `tools/build_qbe.sh` builds the pinned QBE into `build/qbe-src` on CI.
- Tools: `SZC_QBE`/`qbe`, `SZC_CC`/`cc`; pinned QBE revision
  `e786f06032fefa2e3790d6b1c9e31ed138f475a6`. Local QBE: `/data/tools/bin/qbe`.
- Restored sandbox needed libasan/libubsan/clang/compiler-rt reinstalled. Git
  credentials are not persisted; use transient authentication for future pushes.
- M3.4 (`1882ced`) and M3.5 (`7b36edd`) are pushed to `main`.
- CI for M3.6a (`5dcfeb0`): completed successfully.

## Validation at M3.6b

- GCC/Clang sanitizer suites: 518 unit checks, 377 goldens, 12 ordinary e2e inputs,
  one szc-only edge input, 12 driver checks, 115 panic cases. Ordinary/reference
  runs pass with the official Zig 0.17 binary; additional generated seeds 1/42/65535
  match as well. Four 60-second local fuzz runs pass.
- Known reference discrepancy: native @rem/@mod(i64.min, -1) traps in official Zig;
  its comptime evaluator returns zero. szc returns zero. The separate `tests/run_szc`
  case is intentionally executed without ZIG; do not fold it into reference e2e tests.
- `comptime.c` now has alias-safe rounded BigInt division (trunc/floor/ceil).
  @mod accepts negative denominators in 0.17; do not apply older Zig restrictions.

## Validation at M3.6a

- Fresh GCC/Clang `-Werror` sanitizer builds: 515 unit checks, 369 goldens,
  ten e2e inputs, 12 driver checks, 77 generated panic cases; reference validation
  passes with official Zig 0.17.0. GCC optimized build is warning-clean too.
- Standalone fuzz replay and four 60-second libFuzzer runs pass.
- Generated width tests now also exercise non-overflowing checked arithmetic;
  `tests/run/safety_boundaries.zig` covers minima/maxima, zero products, narrowing
  casts and u0. The panic harness checks widths 1/5/8/32/33/64 and compiler success
  separately from SIGABRT/message validation.

## Validation at M3.5

- GCC and Clang fresh `-Werror` ASan/UBSan: 366 goldens, nine executable inputs
  checked with official Zig, 12 driver boundary tests, standalone fuzz replay clean.
- Four libFuzzer targets ran 60 seconds each locally without failures; sema fuzzing
  now also exercises QBE emission. Existing CI push/nightly schedules are retained.
- New CI configuration is pushed; check GitHub Actions for its latest status.
  M3.3's existing CI passed.

## Notes for the next steps

- Reference Zig 0.17.0: source tarball from codeberg (ziglang/zig tag 0.17.0) and the binary
  `https://ziglang.org/download/0.17.0/zig-x86_64-linux-0.17.0.tar.xz`. Always check behavior
  against **these** sources (`lib/std/zig/{tokenizer,Parse,Ast}.zig`), not memory of older Zig.
- Parser differential tests (need the official binary `$ZIG`):
  `$ZIG build-exe tools/ast_spans.zig -OReleaseFast -femit-bin=build/ast_spans`, then
  `tools/diff_ast_spans.sh build/szc build/ast_spans <file-list>` and
  `tools/diff_parse_errors.py build/szc build/ast_spans <file-list> [count] [seed]`.
  `zig fmt --check file.zig` shows the reference's parse error for a mutant.
- Number literals are lexed loosely (like the reference). Validate them when decoding (M3.x).
- Phase 4: the parser already has if/while/for/labels/defer AST nodes; irgen/sema
  still reject these source constructs. Typed IR and codegen already support block,
  condbr, loop and repeat for the boolean/control-flow scaffolding. Extend lowering
  with explicit result blocks and terminators, checking reference behavior first.
- `make safety-test` checks generated runtime panic cases; setting `ZIG` enables
  reference validation. Checks are always enabled in szc for now. Panic stubs
  print one line via libc write, then abort; explicit unreachable still uses hlt.
- Pending user decision: how to build the Zig compiler source (M10.2).
